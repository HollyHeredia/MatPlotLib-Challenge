This project contains data regarding a tumor study across multiple drug regimens. The Jupyter Notebook contains work with this data to: clean it up, make a bar chart regarding the count of how much each drug was measured, a pie chart representing the breakdown between the sexes, box plots exploring the range of data within 4 of the drug regimens, a line plot for one mouse, and a scatter plot for the final tumor volume for one drug along with line regression and statistics regarding the final outcome of one of the drugs.
